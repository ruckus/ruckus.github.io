    <p>If you run a service which allows one to import data, say maybe by uploading a CSV file, than do yourself a favor and store the original file in a place where you can access it later for support or debugging.</p>
<p>Our service allows a person to upload a CSV file containing postal addresses and it has about 8 columns that need to be in a certain order.</p>
<p>Before our code starts to actually process the file we shove it up to S3 in its original form. Later during processing if an error is encountered than a support person can look at the original file and see any obvious errors. Maybe you expect a CSV file but get an Excel (or a Apple Numbers file)? Maybe the customer wasnt paying attention and totally re-arranged the columns. Sure, most of these &ldquo;soft&rdquo; errors (such as CSV vs Excel) can be caught pretty easy by inspecting the file extension, but as a whole you are guaranteed to run into trickier situations.</p>
<p>Either way, having the original file on hand for debugging is super helpful. Much better than emailing the customer and asking them to re-send you the file. In most cases we can be pro-active and email the customer back and say &ldquo;Hi, I saw that you just attempted a data import and it failed, it looks like it was due to &hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
